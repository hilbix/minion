# Web Minions

Web Minions are some miniature helpers loaded from the web.

Do not trust me, so you can clone them to your own webpages if you like.

They are free, as free beer, free speech and free baby.


## Setup

All pages are setup such, that all resources are external, so no embedded scripts and the like.

- So you can use a CSP setting with maximum protection.
- However my server does not support CSP settings for now, hence I cannot test it.

However some scripts might use `eval`.  All such scripts are below `eval/`.

- Usually `eval` is considered evil, however these scripts are done such that it should be safe.


## GDPR note

This note is for all the scripts found here (below this folder):
